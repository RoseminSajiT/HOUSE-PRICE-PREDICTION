This is a house price prediction project using machine learning linear regression techniques.
The house price is predicted based on some user requirements such as no.of bedrooms,no.of bathrooms and total sqft required.
Even though the model gives precise predition(due to big dataset), The accuracy is not up to standard because of some corrections in the dataset.
The main.py is a PyCharm code for the user interface of this project.
